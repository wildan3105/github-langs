## Why does this project exist?

So people can see the stats of programming language being used in their repositories easily.

## Key features
- Show statistics of repo's programming language (overall) from a given github account
- Display the total of each programming language based on github [programming language color](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml)
- Browse the repo with specific programming language directly from the chart bar
- Ability to switch between multicolor or single color (white)
- Ability to download the chart in a JPG file
- Ability to share the result via facebook or X (formerly Twitter)
